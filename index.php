            <p>Air review is an interactive review platform that includes information and reviews on many different airports.</p>
            <p>Users can view all the available airports, create an account, and leave their own review.</p>
            <p>Welcome, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
            <hr>
            <p>How did you incorporate the email functionality?<br><br>
                • I used the mail() built in PHP function to accomplish this, and the email is sent upon successful registration<br><br>
                • Used in "login.php"</p>
            <p>How did you incorporate the file upload functionality?<br><br>
                • Explain how you incorporated this feature (what page requires a file upload).<br><br>
                • Describe any limitations (such as images only).<br>
                • Identify the actual PHP filename so the code is easily found/reviewed.</p>
